# Bank-Loan-Analytics-Dashboard
# Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze customer bank loans and extract insights that can assist in financial decision-making. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as loan performance, customer behavior, and payment status. Dashboards were created using Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and SQL to visualize the results.

2. Grade and Sub-grade-wise Revolving Balance: What is the revolving balance breakdown based on loan grade and sub-grade?
3. Total Payment for Verified vs Non-Verified Loans: How do verified loans compare to non-verified loans in terms of total payment?
4. State-wise, Month-wise Loan Status: What are the loan statuses across different states and months?
5. 5. Home Ownership vs Last Payment Date Status: How does home ownership influence the loan payment status on the last payment date?
